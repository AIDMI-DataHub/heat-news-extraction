      "full_text": "ALOR SETAR: The Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (Risda) is prepared to propose cloud seeding if extreme heat and prolonged drought continue to affect rubber production, particularly in northern Peninsular Malaysia.\nIts chairman Manndzri Nasib said the prolonged hot weather was affecting leaf growth, latex yield and smallholders’ income, with Felda Chuping, Felda Rimba Mas and Felda Mata Ayer in Perlis among the hardest-hit areas.\n“If the situation becomes critical, cloud seeding will be necessary. Otherwise, our community will be affected, trees may die, and eventually they will have to be felled and replanted.\n“So, if it gets serious, Risda will have no choice but to carry out cloud seeding,” he told reporters after launching the Gempak Convention and Risda Kedah’s Smallholders Prosperity Programme here yesterday, Bernama reported.\nManndzri added that extreme heat and drought were recurring challenges, and the agency was studying the best ways to maintain soil moisture and tree health.\nMeasures under review include the use of fertiliser and modern technologies to keep leaves healthy, ensure photosynthesis continues and stabilise latex production.\n“Using fertilisers and modern technology can help trees retain moisture and maintain growth and latex output,” he added.",
