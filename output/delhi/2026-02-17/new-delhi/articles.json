      "full_text": "New Delhi: Delhi saw an early taste of summer as the mercury surpassed 30 degrees Celsius for the first time this season on Monday. The maximum temperature was recorded at 31.6 degrees Celsius, seven degrees above normal. This was also the earliest instance of the temperature crossing 30 degrees Celsius in Feb in the past five years. Earlier, the mercury breached this mark on Feb 11, 2021, when it touched 30.4 degrees Celsius. In Feb 2025, the mercury surpassed this mark in the last week of the month.\nThe mercury is predicted to stay between 29 and 31 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, while the India Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert for Wednesday for spells of light to very light rain accompanied by a thunderstorm and gusty winds up to 40 kmph.\nTOI reported on Monday that winter is almost over, with the city mostly recording above-normal temperatures since the beginning of the month. Safdarjung, which is the city's base station, saw the mercury climb from 28.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday to 31.6 degrees Celsius on Monday. The maximum temperature at Ayanagar in south-west Delhi touched 30.4 degrees Celsius, seven degrees above normal. Though the day temperature settled at 29.2 degrees Celsius at Lodhi Road and 28.4 degrees Celsius at Ridge in north Delhi, it was still five degrees higher than normal.\n\"The mercury has been rising due to clear skies and the absence of any major rain activity. However, under the influence of a western disturbance, the city may see partly cloudy skies on Tuesday, which may cause a marginal dip in temperature. Since rain is expected on Wednesday, the mercury is likely to drop to around 26-28 degrees Celsius,\" said Krishna Mishra, IMD scientist.\nIMD's data shows that in Feb last year, the highest maximum temperature was recorded at 32.4 degrees Celsius on Feb 26. The highest day temperature stood at 29.7 degrees Celsius in Feb 2024, 33.7 degrees Celsius in Feb 2023, 28.4 degrees Celsius in Feb 2022, and 33.2 degrees Celsius in Feb 2021.\nThe Met department said a spell of very light to light rain with a thunderstorm or lightning and gusty winds (speed 30-40 kmph) is likely towards the forenoon on Wednesday. Another spell of very light rain is likely at isolated places towards Wednesday afternoon. \"The mercury may dip to around 26-28 degrees Celsius on Wednesday and Thursday, but it may start rising again from Friday after the influence of a western disturbance is over. The maximum temperature is predicted to touch 28-30 degrees Celsius on Feb 22,\" said an official.\nThe minimum temperature, however, was recorded at 10.1 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. It is likely to rise from Tuesday and may remain around 12-14 degrees Celsius. Delhi's air quality, meanwhile, remained in the ‘poor' category with an AQI of 261. It is likely to stay in this range on Tuesday.",

      "full_text": "Delhi records hottest day of yr, max temps soar above normal\nNEW DELHI: Delhi recorded its hottest day of the year on Monday, with maximum temperatures rising sharply above seasonal norms, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.\nThe Safdarjung observatory logged a maximum of 31.6 degrees Celsius, 7.2 degrees above normal and 3.1 degrees higher than the previous day. Ayanagar recorded 30.4 degrees Celsius, also over 7 degrees above average. Lodi Road and Ridge reported 29.2 degrees and 28.4 degrees Celsius, respectively, both more than 5 degrees above normal.

Safdarjung recorded 10.1 degrees Celsius and Ayanagar 9.4 degrees Celsius.\nAir quality stayed in the ‘poor’ category, with an AQI of 258, according to the CPCB. Skymet Vice-President Mahesh Palawat said the unusual mid-February heat was due to clear skies and low wind speed, with a western disturbance likely to bring\nlight rain and marginal relief in the coming days.",
