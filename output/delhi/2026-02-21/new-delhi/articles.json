The minimum temperature was recorded at 12.8°C on Friday.\nThe Air Quality Early Warning System (AQEWS) forecast stated that the AQI is likely to remain in the poor category till Monday, and fluctuate between the “poor” and “moderate” categories afterwards.\nWeather experts said the temperatures will continue to gradually increase. “Although a western disturbance is expected on February 22, it will be very feeble and will not have any significant impact. Skies are expected to remain clear with little sign of rain, causing both day and night temperatures to rise,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president of Skymet Weather.\nPalawat added that the lack of improvement in the AQI was primarily due to the wind speed being low. “The improvement depends on the speed and direction of wind. If the wind speed is at least 12-15kmph, the AQI will remain in the moderate category, or the lower end of the poor category. When wind speeds drop below that, it cannot disperse the pollutants, and the AQI continues to rise.”",
