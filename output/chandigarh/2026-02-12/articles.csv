Cr Ryan Brooke moved a motion that the council investigate initiatives to provide heat relief within the local government area (LGA) as the first piece of business for the new year.
This motion will explore options like free pool admission, opening up air-conditioned council buildings to the public, expanding the number of bubblers and water bottle refill stations across the region, and placing signage warning of the dangers of swimming in the river, after a 16-year-old boy drowned in the Peel River late last year.
Cr Brooke said, as the closest level of government, the council is best-placed to deal with extreme heat for residents, and that the council should look at options for using its facilities to provide heat relief for residents without pools or air-conditioning.
Cr Marc Sutherland supported the motion, saying that the council has a responsibility not only to maximise the use of assets but also to protect the vulnerable, and suggested private alternatives like pubs were not always appropriate.
""I would like to see it eventually turn into a toolkit, or something that we could promote, to say, yes, there are other venues outside of council's jurisdiction, there are pubs and restaurants and service clubs,"" Cr Sutherland said.
""But, you know, as a father with a young family in a heatwave, I wouldn't want to be rushing the family to sit down at the pub to enjoy the air-conditioning.""
Cr Charles Impey also supported the idea, noting that it was only an investigation, not a plan to go ahead and make the changes, and that the state government does not have all the answers or tools for problems at a local level.
""Heatwaves probably are considered a natural disaster,"" Cr Impey said, ""but they're probably considered a disaster for a lot of our residents who don't have the luxury of air-conditioning or access to a pool - and there are a lot of residents who don't have access to that.""
Cr Mark Rodda said he supported the motion, saying it was ""a well-meaning motion - and it's only asking for recommendations.""
Not all were in agreement, with Cr Matt Sharpham saying that the motion had no financial implications listed in it, that he did not think the summers were that hot and that climate change was a myth.
""I think people just want to enjoy the great Australian summer,"" Cr Sharpham said.
""We're a land of extremes, and these climate activists are destroying our economy and environment in the name of a myth.""
Cr Sharpham also pointed out that if it was a health issue, it should be the state's, not the council's, responsibility, and that there were plenty of pubs, shopping centres, and restaurants that residents could use to escape the heat.
Cr Jeff Budd said that contingency plans for emergencies such as heatwaves already exist at a state level.
""A little research clearly shows we do not have to reinvent the wheel,"" Cr Budd said, but acknowledged that Cr Brooke's concerns were valid.
""That is to be commended, but I can't support it based on the fact that it already exists.""
Speaking before the vote, mayor Russell Webb called it was another example of ""cost-shifting"", saying that extreme heat is a health issue, and that health issues are handled by the state government, not local government.
""This is really just a cost-shifting exercise,"" he said, adding that cold, not heat, was the real problem for the vulnerable, especially the elderly.
The motion was passed five to three.
Speaking at a news conference after the meeting, Cr Webb respected the vote of the council despite his objections.
""I'll say to you that the temperatures in Tamworth do not get as hot as they do further out west, and areas further out west probably do not have the facilities in their local government area to cater for some of the needy,"" Cr Webb said.
""But we will certainly be looking at what initiatives we can put in place as a result of the motion last night, to see what we can offer further than what we already do.""",0.8500000000000001
