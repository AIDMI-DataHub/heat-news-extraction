"Robots become 'human eyes and hands,' take on dangerous inspections on oil and gas platforms, enter areas with toxic gas, extreme heat and pressure, and push the market toward US$205,5 billion. - CPG Click Petróleo e Gás",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0AJBVV95cUxOdGpnZ0M4VFY4UGVMcGxhN2otQ1RHdzFpenh1SVd1R09sT0tMaWFEVEhmNC1OQzhSeGlucEZTOUgwdWMtek5IN3FIdFVhT2RuY3VnTWE4a1NnRl9WOF9hNW1wbUZ6UnItZXpLYzRCWlloVGR1VEJpZmNQc1U5ZkVxWGt6WlYtRlJhTWpneC13OWRkTlpSWXNobDFiR3BYMUNtSnpYdWxhdk94U3V2MDJXQUk2SGx0S1RCZ1VkNmtWNEtzenJCX3llckdPbWRKMElBbGk2RGJCUlR3Wi1GbzNKQWIxcWRDU1RuR0tKWWM1T25ZNl90bW1jWVRFeHRJV3NLbEUzZ3BXTkItSUdXZjBuTmFjR3M1Q014X1NBZU5taXlXX2FGdnozWnhUVlZwb0VRZHlCMGpyWHNYMDV4a0NOamxBQ3JWNkpjLTdSVHZ4STk?oc=5,CPG Click Petróleo e Gás,2026-02-12T14:45:00+05:30,en,Assam,,"(heatwave OR ""heat wave"" OR ""severe heatwave"" OR ""extreme heat"" OR ""heat spell"" OR ""scorching heat"" OR ""blistering heat"" OR ""sweltering heat"" OR ""hot winds"" OR loo OR ""hot loo winds"" OR ""intense heat"" OR ""unbearable heat"" OR ""deadly heat"") Assam","Robots become 'human eyes and hands,' take on dangerous inspections on oil and gas platforms, enter areas with toxic gas, extreme heat and pressure, and push the market toward US$205,5 billion.
Oil and gas giants like Equinor, Shell, BP, Chevron, TotalEnergies, Repsol, and ADNOC are using AI-powered robots, cloud computing, and sensors to inspect assets, predict failures, and reduce human risk in onshore, offshore, and subsea operations.
Robots are no longer a distant promise in oil and gas operations. They are already in the fields, at sea, and in structures where human intervention is expensive and can go wrong in seconds.
The reason is straightforward. With artificial intelligence, improved sensors, and access to cloud data, these machines can navigate complex environments, work autonomously, and support decision-making with near real-time information.
The results are evident where it hurts the sector most: inspection, maintenance, and monitoring. This applies from exploration to transportation and refining, focusing on reducing risk, improving efficiency, and keeping older assets operational with greater control.
From pipeline inspections to platforms and tanks, robots become ""eyes and hands"" in critical areas.
Robotics has made a significant impact on tasks that previously required human exposure to danger and discomfort. Examples of applications include inspections of pipelines, flare towers, storage tanks, offshore platforms, and subsea infrastructure.
For this purpose, various types of robots have emerged, each with a very practical function.
Autonomous underwater vehicles scan and inspect the seabed. Tracked robots navigate difficult areas. Quadruped robots walk through industrial structures. Certified inspection platforms for classified areas enter areas where there may be a risk of gas explosions.
Logic is not just about seeing the problem, it's about acting early. Finding a problem before it becomes an unplanned stoppage changes both cost and safety at the same time.
AI, cloud computing, and sensors collect data in real time and are crucial in decision-making.
The shift didn't happen simply by placing a robot in the location. The leap comes from the combination of robotics with artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and advanced sensors.
This opens up opportunities for real-time analysis, predictive maintenance, and condition-based asset management, which is the idea of caring for equipment based on actual signs of wear and tear, not just according to a calendar.
Also included is emissions detection, which becomes a priority in operations that need to demonstrate environmental, social, and governance control, which the market usually summarizes in the acronym ESG, but which in practice is a demand for safer, cleaner, and more traceable operations.
According to Offshore Technology, this automation package is reshaping how operators handle inspection and maintenance across the entire oil and gas chain, from the field to refining.
The market, already worth US$90,2 billion, and the projection that is driving the sector along with it.
The numbers put the issue on another level.
GlobalData forecasts indicate that the global robotics market was valued at US$90,2 billion in 2024 and could reach US$205,5 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 15%.
Within this context, service robots represent the largest segment, because that's where there is strong demand for inspection, monitoring, and maintenance in complex industrial environments.
Oil and gas appear as an engine of this growth for three very practical reasons: aging infrastructure, labor constraints, and greater demands for safety and environmental control.
In the sea and on the ocean floor, robots do what is expensive and risky for people.
Offshore and submarine operations have one factor that no one ignores: the environment is hostile.
Adverse conditions, extreme pressure, and limited access make human intervention more expensive and riskier. This is where robotics more easily gains ground, because robots don't need air, don't get tired, and can be designed to operate in conditions that would be impractical for a human team.
And the presence of robotics isn't limited to the sea. On land, the benefits become apparent when robots enter confined spaces, high-temperature areas, and zones with toxic or explosive gases, allowing for rapid assessment and early intervention without putting people at risk.
What is still hindering adoption and why does the sector persist anyway?
Even with clear advantages, adoption is not automatic. There are cited obstacles, such as capital investment, systems integration, and reliability in extreme environments.
But the sector is pushing the technology forward with another layer: digital twins, cutting-edge intelligence, and predictive analytics. The idea is to create smarter operations, with less surprise and more control.
As these capabilities mature, robotics is expected to become a cornerstone of more automated, resilient, and sustainable oil and gas operations.
If robots can already inspect pipelines, tanks, and hazardous structures without putting people at risk, what is the most likely next step: complete maintenance without on-site crews, or simply more frequent and cheaper inspections?

Early this afternoon, the Bureau of Meteorology also issued a severe weather warning for the Gold Coast, Toowoomba, Brisbane, Dalby, Kingaroy, Caboolture, Ipswich, Gatton, Cleveland, Cherbourg, Jimboomba and Kilcoy as potentially affected areas.
Senior Meteorologist Angus Hines said that it will be the first significant rainfall for Ipswich and the South-East for some time.
“I know people that are looking for the rainfall but it might be coming in too hard and fast in some locations,” he said.

“When it hasn’t rained for a while, a big long soft soaking of rain is ideal but this is going to be more of storm driven rain.
“So, it could come through really punchy, really heavy and really could come through pretty quickly, which may lead to a bit of run off and flash flooding concerns before that rain can soak into the landscape,” Mr Hines said.
Senior Forecaster Angus Hines said that within the next 24 hours there will be significant rainfall across the South-East.
“The rain is kicking in later today with the potential for storms tonight and overnight.
“There will really be significant rainfall accumulations in Ipswich and surrounds, I wouldn’t rule out triple figures — 100 to 200 mm in some parts,” he said.
