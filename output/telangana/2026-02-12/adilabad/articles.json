Temperatures Soar To 35°C In February As Winter Bids Goodbye Across Telangana\nHyderabad braces for rising February heat as temperatures climb to 35°C under clear skies. No rain forecast across Telangana; experts advise hydration and sun safety.\nHyderabad is set to experience a steady rise in temperatures as winter gradually loosens its grip over Telangana. According to the latest forecast, the city will witness mostly clear skies on Thursday, February 12, 2026, with daytime heat intensifying as the sun climbs higher.\nWhile early morning hours may bring mild, cool breezes offering temporary relief, the warmth is expected to build rapidly after sunrise. The maximum temperature in Hyderabad is likely to hover between 33°C and 35°C, slightly above the average for February.\nRecommended Stories\n- Telangana Weather Update: Nights Turn Pleasant In Hyderabad As Daytime Heat Gradually Rises\n- TS ICET 2026 Notification: Registration Begins February 12, Check Exam Schedule\n- TS ICET 2026 Application Begins At icet.tgche.ac.in: Direct Link, Exam Schedule\n- 'BRS Extorted Crores Of Money, Grabbed Land': Telangana CM Revanth Reddy On Phone-Tapping Row\nNight and early morning temperatures are expected to remain relatively comfortable, ranging between 17°C and 19°C.\nMeteorologists note that humidity levels could dip to around 20–30% during the afternoon, contributing to dry weather conditions. In some busy parts of the city, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is likely to remain in the ‘Moderate’ category.\nWeather Across Telangana\nThe impact of rising heat is not limited to Hyderabad alone. Several districts across Telangana are already experiencing warmer-than-usual conditions for this time of year.\nNorthern Districts: Nizamabad, Adilabad: In northern Telangana, particularly in Nizamabad and Adilabad, daytime temperatures may touch the 35°C mark. However, cooler nights continue, creating noticeable temperature variations between day and night.\nEastern Districts: Khammam, Warangal: In districts such as Khammam and Warangal, dry weather is expected to prevail. Reduced moisture in the air may lead to discomfort during peak afternoon hours, especially for those spending extended time outdoors.\nRainfall Outlook: The Meteorological Department has clarified that there are currently no weather systems, troughs, or low-pressure areas influencing Telangana. As a result, no rainfall is forecast across the state in the immediate future. Clear skies and dry conditions are expected to dominate.\nAdvisory for Residents\nWith February temperatures already climbing above seasonal norms, experts recommend precautionary measures to avoid heat-related discomfort.\nStay Hydrated: Dry weather increases the risk of dehydration. Residents are advised to drink sufficient water throughout the day, even if they do not feel excessively thirsty.\nSun Protection: Those stepping out between 12 pm and 4 pm, when the sun is at its strongest, should consider using umbrellas, caps, or protective clothing to reduce direct sun exposure.\nMorning and Night Chill: Despite warm afternoons, early mornings can still feel cool. Parents and caregivers should ensure that children and elderly individuals remain protected from sudden temperature fluctuations, particularly to avoid respiratory issues.\nOverall, the prevailing weather pattern indicates that summer-like conditions are gradually setting in across Telangana. As the sun’s intensity strengthens day by day, residents are urged to stay cautious and adapt to the changing climate conditions.\nview comments",
