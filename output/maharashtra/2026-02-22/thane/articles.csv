Mumbai recorded a maximum temperature of 36.3°C on Saturday, marking the highest temperature of the season so far. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has indicated that temperatures are likely to remain between 34°C and 35°C over the next two days.
Citizens across the city and suburbs experienced intense heat and hot winds, making it uncomfortable to step outdoors. The sun was particularly harsh between 11 am and 4 pm. Similar weather conditions are expected to continue on Sunday.
Temperatures Across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region
Mumbai – 36.3°C

What Caused the Rise in Temperature?
According to weather experts, hot easterly winds have been preventing the usual sea breeze from moving inland. This disruption has led to a noticeable spike in temperatures across Mumbai and nearby areas. Some relief is expected after Tuesday as weather conditions may change.
Weather expert Krishnanand Hosalikar said, “On February 21, Mumbai crossed the 36°C mark in maximum temperature. The recorded daytime temperatures in the city and suburbs were about 4°C above normal. As a result, the intensity of heat is being felt as early as February. Citizens should avoid stepping out during afternoon hours and take necessary precautions.”
