      "full_text": "Two regions on red alert – Where will the bad weather strike\nΔιαβάζεται σε 5'Warning from the National Meteorological Service for two waves of bad weather. What the new emergency weather report says. Instructions from Civil Protection.\n- 11 Φεβρουαρίου 2026 14:13\nThe government machinery is on high alert once again due to the impending 48-hour bad weather.\nSpecifically, as announced by the Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection, the General Secretariat for Civil Protection, following the issuance of the Emergency Weather Warning by the National Meteorological Service (EMY), has mobilized the Regional Units of Achaia and Ilia in the Western Greece Region, placing them under “Red Code” status from today until Friday, to address risks from potential flooding events.\nAdditionally, municipalities and regions are urged to immediately convene the Local Operational Coordinating Bodies (T.E.S.O.P.P.) and Regional Operational Coordinating Bodies (P.E.S.O.P.P.).\nIt is reminded that earlier, on Wednesday morning (February 11), the National Meteorological Service issued a new emergency weather update, warning of a “double storm” with heavy rains, thunderstorms, and gale-force winds.\nSpecifically, it is forecast that two consecutive atmospheric disturbances will affect the weather in the country. The first is expected from early this evening, Wednesday (February 11), until the early morning hours of Thursday (February 12), and the second from late Thursday afternoon until the morning hours of Friday (February 13), with heavy rains and thunderstorms and very strong winds.\nFirst wave of bad weather:\nHeavy rains and thunderstorms:\n- In the Ionian islands from Lefkada southwards, western Peloponnese, and western Sterea from early this evening Wednesday until the early hours of Thursday.\n- In Crete, the Cyclades, and eastern Peloponnese during the night from Wednesday to Thursday.\n- In Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (mainly in Thassos, Samothrace, and coastal mainland areas) on Thursday until the morning hours.\n- In the Dodecanese and the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean on Thursday until the morning hours.\nVery strong to gale-force south-southwest winds will blow:\n- In western Greece on Wednesday evening and in the southern Aegean (Crete, Cyclades, and Dodecanese) on Thursday until the early morning hours.\nSecond wave of bad weather:\nHeavy rains and thunderstorms:\n- In western and southern Peloponnese and Ionian Islands (Zakynthos, Kefalonia, Ithaca) from late Thursday afternoon until the early morning hours of Friday.\n- In Crete and the Cyclades during Thursday night to Friday.\n- In the Dodecanese and the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean on Friday until the morning hours.\n- In Thrace temporarily on Friday morning (February 13).\nVery strong to gale-force winds will blow:\nIn western Greece on Thursday evening (south-southwest winds) and Friday morning (west-northwest winds), and in the southern Aegean (Crete, Cyclades, and Dodecanese) on Friday until noon.\nCivil Protection Recommendations:\nIn areas where heavy rain, thunderstorms, or gale-force winds are expected, the General Secretariat for Civil Protection advises citizens to:\n- Secure objects that could be swept away by severe weather, which may cause damage or injuries.\n- Ensure that gutters and drains at homes are not blocked and are functioning correctly.\n- Avoid crossing streams and torrents on foot or by vehicle during storms and rain, and for several hours afterward. Special caution is needed where roads intersect with torrents and there is no bridge.\n- Avoid outdoor activities and sea or coastal areas during severe weather (risk of lightning strikes).\n- Seek shelter during hailstorms in a building or car and remain in a safe place until the storm has passed.\n- Avoid areas under large trees, hanging signs, or places where light objects (e.g., flowerpots, broken glass, etc.) might fall (e.g., under balconies).\n- Follow instructions from local authorities, such as traffic police.\nFor Thunderstorm Activity:\nIf you are indoors:\n- Avoid using electrical appliances or telephones as lightning can pass through wires.\n- Unplug television sets from antennas and electrical outlets.\n- Avoid touching plumbing as it conducts electricity.\nIf you are in a car:\n- Pull over to the side of the road and stay away from trees that may fall on the car.\n- Stay inside, turn on hazard lights until the storm subsides.\n- Keep windows closed and avoid touching metal objects.\n- Avoid flooded roads.\nIf you are outdoors:\n- Seek shelter in a building or car, or sit on the ground (do not lie down).\n- Protect yourself under solid branches of low trees in the forest.\n- Never seek shelter under tall trees in open areas.\n- Avoid low-lying areas due to flood risk.\n- Do not stand next to power poles, power lines, telephone lines, or fences.\n- Keep away from metal objects (e.g., cars, bicycles, camping gear, etc.).\n- Stay away from rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water.\n- If in the sea, immediately get out.\n- If in an open area and feel your hair stand up (a sign of an imminent lightning strike), crouch down with your head between your knees and discard any metal objects.\nFor updates on the weather and road conditions due to floods or snowfall, visit the Greek Police website or the Civil Protection website for more information.",

      "full_text": "Millions of WhatsApp users placed on red alert — protect your chat app with these 3 steps NOW\nHackers can access everything on your Android phone with new scam\n- Google's Project Zero team uncovered a security flaw in WhatsApp\n- Hackers can access everything on your Android phone\n- They could read your messages, check banking apps, and view photos\n- You can secure your account by taking three easy steps\nDon't Miss\nMost Read\nHackers could hijack millions of WhatsApp users with a single file.\nGoogle's Project Zero team recently uncovered a troubling security flaw inside the Meta-owned chat app that could let hackers seize control of your Android smartphone by sending a malicious file to your phone.\nIf your device downloads the malware-laced file, criminals can gain access to everything on your handset — allowing them to impersonate you in conversations via WhatsApp, unlock banking apps, access your photos, and much more.\nWhat makes this especially concerning is that it's a zero-click attack: you don't need to tap or open anything for the malicious file to take hold of your device. This type of hacking attempt seems to be successful too, as they keep cropping up in different forms across the messaging app and other platforms.\nA similar type of scheme was detected on WhatsApp just under two months ago, where hackers didn't need to bypass authentication checks to steal your data. Google also recently confirmed that hackers are targeting Gmail accounts. Here's everything you need to know about how it works, and how you can protect yourself now.\nAs of this year, more than 3 billion people use WhatsApp monthly globally\n|WHATSAPP PRESS OFFICE\nThe terrifying hack only works if you have WhatsApp's automatic media download feature enabled on your Android device. This time-saving feature saves photos, videos, and documents to your device without you lifting a finger. Sounds convenient, but it turns out this handy function can be exploited by cybercriminals looking to sneak infected files onto your phone through group chats.\nThat's because malware-laced files will be automatically downloaded to your device — letting the virus spread before you've even realised that you've been sent the offending file.\nTo spread the malware, hackers often impersonate one of your contacts, setting up fake group chats and inviting you to join. Once you accept that invitation, infected files are sent and will download automatically without you ever knowing something's gone wrong.\nAccording to Project Zero, attackers are most likely to use this method in targeted campaigns, since they need to know at least one of your contacts to be able to impersonate them.\nTo combat the potential attacks, Meta pushed out a fix as early as November 11, 2025, but Google says that it only partially resolved the issue on Android. Meta is currently working on a more permanent fix.\nIn the meantime, you can follow these steps to secure your account.\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS\n- Would YOU pay to use WhatsApp? Future updates to chat app could carry monthly fee\n- Second-ever Freely TV box unveiled with cheapest price yet\n- Best VPN deals\n- ExpressVPN issues critical update — install NOW or lose VPN access\n- 149 million online accounts leak, including Gmail, Netflix, Yahoo, more\n- Best cheap VPN\n1. Switch off WhatsApp's automatic media download feature\nSince using WhatsApp's automatic media download feature seems to be the main way hackers can get through to your account, it may be best to switch it off completely.\nOn Android\n- Open WhatsApp\n- Tap the three dots (top right) → Settings\n- Tap Storage and data\n- Under Media auto-download, tap:\n- When using mobile data\n- When connected on Wi-Fi\n- When roaming\n- Uncheck all media types (Photos, Audio, Videos, Documents)\nBonus tip (very useful)\nIf you only want to stop specific chats from saving media:\n- Open the chat → tap the contact/group name\n- Select Media visibility\n- Set to No\nOnce you've done this, each category should show \"No media\" underneath it. This stops any dodgy files from silently landing on your phone the moment you're added to a group chat.\nYou can tailor how media is downloaded to your mobile in the WhatsApp media auto-download settings\n|WHATSAPP | GB NEWS\n2. Limit your group chat access\nSince this attack relies on criminals adding you to dodgy group chats, you can limit who has that power.\nOn Android\n- Open WhatsApp\n- Tap the three dots → Settings\n- Tap Privacy\n- Tap Groups\n- Select:\n- Everyone\n- My contacts\n- My contacts except…\nIf you use WhatsApp for work, it's also worth keeping group access restricted to people you know and trusted administrators only. This way, you can limit the risk of leaking any company data unknowingly.\nYou can edit who can add you to group chats on WhatsApp\n|WHATSAPP | GB NEWS\n3. Keep your WhatsApp updated\nIt's always best practice to make sure you're running the latest version of WhatsApp. Keeping your apps updated is one of the simplest ways to stay protected.\nInstead of checking periodically to see if you need to update your chat app, you can switch on automatic updates within your mobile's settings.\nIn extreme circumstances, WhatsApp has just rolled out a brand-new Strict Account Settings feature on the platform. When enabled, it reduces your vulnerability to cyber attack by limiting functionality. This lockdown mode will block incoming attachments, photos, and videos from anyone outside of your contacts.\nMore From GB News",
